Introduction
Reconnaissance is the foundation of any successful bug bounty journey and one of the most overlooked goldmines is GitHub. Developers often unknowingly push sensitive data into public repositories, giving ethical hackers a powerful vector to uncover secrets, tokens, credentials and much more.

In this article, I‚Äôll walk you through manual and automated techniques to extract valuable data from GitHub. We‚Äôll use filters, dorks and tools everything you need to perform impactful recon using only open-source intelligence (OSINT).

Basic Search Tactics
Start by heading over to GitHub.com and typing your target domain along with a sensitive keyword in the search bar.

Example:

"example.com" password
This will show repositories and files containing the keyword ‚Äúpassword‚Äù that are linked to the example.com domain.

JSON-Formatted Keyword Searches
To make the results more relevant, format your keyword like a JSON key-value pair.

Example:


"example.com" "password":
Why? Because secrets stored in JSON often follow a predictable key-value pattern. This helps filter out noise and lets you focus on the juicy stuff credentials, API keys and access tokens.

You‚Äôll immediately notice a smaller set of results but each is more precise, containing values like:

"username": "admin",
"password": "supersecret123"
Use org: Filter for Official Repositories
If your target has a public GitHub organization use the org: filter.

Example:

org:example "password":
This limits results to repositories officially owned by the organization. However many bug bounty programs don‚Äôt use GitHub orgs so you‚Äôll still rely on general keyword searches for most targets.

Custom GitHub Dorks for Recon
To save time use a custom GitHub dork with logical operators: AND,OR

Example:

"domain" AND ("api_key" OR "secret" OR "password" OR "access_token" OR "client_secret" OR "private_key" OR "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" OR "DB_PASSWORD" OR "slack_token" OR "github_token" OR "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY")
This dork pulls results that match any of these keywords. This way you won‚Äôt need to search for each keyword separately. You‚Äôll get all relevant results at once.

Filtering by Path, Language and File Type
During reconnaissance, filtering by path, language and file type helps narrow down valuable targets. Below are some common filters to use:

filename: Search by specific file names (e.g. filename:.env)
extension: Filter by file type (e.g. extension:json)
path: Search within specific directories (e.g. path:/config)
org: Limit results to an organization (e.g. org:my-company)
repo: Focus on a specific repository (e.g. repo:my-project)
1. Filename: ‚Äî Search by Specific File Name
filename:.env "DB_PASSWORD"
Finds all .env files containing the keyword DB_PASSWORD. .env files often include credentials, secrets and API keys.

2. Extension: ‚Äî Filter by File Type
extension:json "access_token"
Searches all .json files across GitHub that contain the string access_token. Great for finding exposed tokens in config files.

3. path: ‚Äî Search Within Specific Directories
path:/config filename:database.php       # Finds database.php inside any /config directory
path:/wp-config.php                      # Targets the WordPress config file
path:/src/secrets                        # Looks in typical config directories
path:/settings                           # Looks in typical settings directories
path:/.ssh                               # Searches hidden .ssh folder
path:/.git                               # Searches hidden .git folder
path:**/.env                             # Finds .env files in any nested directory

Use the path: filter to find files located in specific folders or subdirectories. This is useful for locating sensitive files commonly stored in predictable paths.

4. repo: ‚Äî Focus on a Specific Repository
repo:vercel/next.js filename:config.js
Limits search to the vercel/next.js repo and looks for config.js files. Great when you‚Äôre auditing a specific open-source project.

Bonus: Combine Filters for Maximum Precision
Find files that contain both ‚Äúpassword‚Äù and ‚Äúdomain‚Äù keywords anywhere within a specific language, such as .php, .jsp or .asp.

"domain" language:PHP password
This dork searches for PHP files that contain both the word ‚Äúpassword‚Äù and ‚Äúdomain‚Äù anywhere in the content. It‚Äôs useful when you‚Äôre looking for potential credentials or sensitive data related to your domain.

Note: Many of these credentials are committed by random developers. It‚Äôs crucial to confirm if they belong to your target‚Äôs assets before reporting.

Keyword Variations
Don‚Äôt just search for ‚Äúpassword.‚Äù Try variations like:

password
passwd
pwd
pass
Advanced Keyword Search (Highly Sensitive Keys & Tokens)
Focus on keywords that reveal critical secrets like API keys, passwords and private tokens commonly found in code and config files.

Authentication & Secrets
api_key
access_token
client_secret
auth_token
authorizationToken
x-api-key
secret
SECRET_KEY

Automation with GitGraber
Manual recon is great, but for mass scale use GitGraber tool, Install GitGraber and run:

# Search for sensitive data related to the entire organization
python3 gitGraber.py -k wordlists/keywords.txt -q nasa.gov -s

# Search for sensitive data related strictly to the domain
python3 gitGraber.py -k wordlists/keywords.txt -q "nasa.gov" -s

It‚Äôll scrape and sort all keyword matches in seconds. Even better, you get direct URLs, timestamps and raw JSON preview.

Using TruffleHog for Deep Secret Scanning
TruffleHog is another powerful tool for hunting secrets in code repositories. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

# Scan a local Git repository
trufflehog git file:///home/user/my-repo

# Scan a public GitHub repository
trufflehog git https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Scan with filtering results to show only verified and unknown findings
trufflehog git https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --results=verified,unknown

# Scan and format output as JSON using jq for readability
trufflehog git https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --results=verified,unknown --json | jq

# Scan a GitHub repository and include issue and PR comments in the scan
trufflehog github --repo=https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --issue-comments --pr-comments

# Scan all repositories in a GitHub organization using a personal access token
trufflehog github --org=nasa --token=yourgithubtoken

# Scan a specific GitHub repository (basic usage)
trufflehog github --repo=https://github.com/username/repo


These trufflehog commands help detect exposed secrets (like API keys, credentials, tokens) in Git repositories. You can scan local repos, GitHub repositories or entire organizations. Additional flags allow filtering results, parsing JSON and scanning comments in issues and PRs for deeper coverage.

Mass Hunting .git Directory Exposure
. git directories on public websites are another goldmine. Why? Because they store the entire source code history, including deleted but restorable files.

Using Nuclei private template
cat domains.txt | nuclei -t gitExposed.yaml

Find Exposed .git Repositories with httpx-toolkit
httpx-toolkit -l subs.txt -path /.git/ -mc 200
cat domains.txt | httpx-toolkit -sc -server -cl -path "/.git/" -mc 200 -location -ms "Index of" -probe
cat domains.txt | grep "SUCCESS" | gf urls | httpx-toolkit -sc -server -cl -path "/.git/" -mc 200 -location -ms "Index of" -probe

This httpx-toolkit command scans a list of domains for exposed .git/ directories. It:

Probes the /.git/ path
Filters responses with status code 200
Matches content with ‚ÄúIndex of‚Äù
Shows response status code, server header, content length and redirect location
Instantly Detect Git Leaks with This Extension
Install the .git browser extension. it automatically alerts you if any site exposes its Git repository, helping you quickly spot misconfigurations and potential attack surfaces during recon


DotGit - Chrome Web Store

chromewebstore.google.com

üí° Tip: Even if a site returns a 403 Forbidden for /.git/ , don‚Äôt give up‚Äîsome Git files might still be accessible. Use tools like GitDumper to attempt extraction and reconstruction of the repository.

Dumping Git Repositories
Next Step: Once you‚Äôve identified a valid .git/ folder using the methods above, it‚Äôs time to dump the repository contents. Use tools like GitTools, git-dumper or git-extractor to recover exposed files and inspect the source code.

 ./gitdumper.sh  https://domain.com/.git/ outputdir

git-dumper https://domain.com/.git/ outputdir

Restoring Deleted Files and File Structure Review
After dumping the .git folder the next step is to rebuild the full file structure. This helps uncover deleted files, sensitive data and historical changes that may still exist in the Git history.

Run the following commands to restore and inspect the repository:

cd output_dir
git status
git restore .
git checkout .
