Introduction
Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Homograph Attacks take advantage of characters from different languages that look nearly identical, such as the Latin ‚Äúa‚Äù and the Cyrillic ‚Äú–∞‚Äù. While it might look like a regular domain or email on the surface, what‚Äôs really happening behind the scenes is a character-swap using similar-looking but technically different Unicode characters.

For example:

Unicode Email: –∞dmin@example.com
Punycode Format: xn ‚Äî dmin-7cd@example.com
When systems like email providers or authentication flows fail to properly distinguish between these visually similar characters, it can result in serious vulnerabilities. This includes account takeovers during sign-up, password resets or even bypassing 2FA protections, posing a high risk if not properly mitigated.

Difference between Punycode & IDN Homograph Attacks
What Is Punycode?
Punycode is a way to represent Unicode characters using only the ASCII character set, making it compatible with systems that don‚Äôt support Unicode directly, like domain name systems.

Example:

The Unicode email security@gm√†il.com (with the special "√†" character) becomes:
security@xn--gml-hoa.com
This looks very similar to security@gmail.com, but actually points to a different domain making it a powerful trick used in phishing, account takeover, and 2FA bypass attacks.

What Are IDN Homograph Attacks?
These attacks trick the system (and sometimes the user) into thinking two visually similar strings are the same but under the hood, they‚Äôre entirely different.

Example:

"admin@example.com" vs "–∞dmin@example.com" (Cyrillic "–∞")
Look identical, don‚Äôt they?

Lab Setup & Tools Required
Burp Suite ‚Äî to intercept and modify HTTP requests
Burp Collaborator ‚Äî your SMTP/email callback server
Punycode Generator ‚Äî to encode Unicode characters
No IDN domain or SMTP server is required for this poc. i‚Äôll simulate the attack using Burpsuite only..

Step-by-Step Exploit Walkthrough
Let‚Äôs break it down from a simple signup to full-blown account takeover, step by step using lab created by Voorivex‚Äôs Team.

Step 1: Register With a Normal Email
Go to any target website that allows email signup could be any login page and register a new account with a normal email. For receiving email callbacks, we‚Äôre going to use Burp Collaborator, which acts like your fake SMTP server.

Validate Account Functionality
After signing up, log in using the same credentials just to confirm that the account is working as expected and after that logout the account


Step 2: Use Punycode in Email & Re-Signup
We‚Äôre going to sign up again, but this time we‚Äôll use Punycode characters inside the email address. You can use the script I created. it shows you all the available Punycode characters along with their encoded values. Just type in any alphabet you want to convert, and it‚Äôll generate the Punycode for you.

You can see that I simply replaced the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù in the email domain with ‚Äú√†‚Äù using a Punycode generator I created. You can also verify the result using any online Punycode decoder such as the Punycoder website.

3: Intercept and Replace with Punycode in Burp
Here‚Äôs something important: browsers like Chrome automatically encode special characters, which will break this trick. So, you need to use Burp Suite to intercept the request and replace the email field manually with your Punycode version email like this and forward the request


Observe Duplicate Email Response
if the response says something like ‚ÄúEmail already exists,‚Äù it means the application is treating both the original and Punycode email as the same after normalization. That‚Äôs a clear sign of misconfiguration and a potential vulnerability.


Step 4: Trigger Password Reset via Punycode Email
Now go to the ‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù or reset password page. Enter the Punycode version of the email address and again, do it through Burp Suite so the characters don‚Äôt get encoded

Step 5: Take Over the Account
Forward the request and now you should see an SMTP callback in Burp Collaborator with the password reset link. Copy that link, open it in your browser and reset the password.



Now, Try logging in again but this time with the original email, the non-Punycode one and the new password you just set.



And.. Boom you‚Äôre in. You‚Äôve just taken over the account. Isn‚Äôt this one of the cleanest and most dangerous account takeover techniques you‚Äôve seen? No user interaction, no phishing, no clicking links. just smart use of punycode email. That‚Äôs why this is considered a critical vulnerability and programs are paying such high bounties when it‚Äôs discovered on main website.

Advanced Method: Punycode in the Username Field
We‚Äôve already explored how email normalization at the domain level can lead to account takeover. But what if the vulnerability exists in the username part of the email instead?

This method is even sneakier because most developers don‚Äôt sanitize the local-part of emails properly, especially when it involves Unicode characters.

How It Works:
Register this time using a Punycode-modified username like:
·π°ecurity@gmail.com.bcrkly6yl8ke552nzjt7jtu52w8nwdk2.oastify.com
2. Again use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request because browsers will encode Unicode characters by default.

3. If the server accepts this email and registers the account, that‚Äôs the first win.

4. Next, go to the ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù form and this time input the non-Punycode version in user part:

security@gmail.com.bcrkly6yl8ke552nzjt7jtu52w8nwdk2.oastify.com
5. If you receive a reset email in Burp Collaborator, you‚Äôve confirmed that the server is treating both as the same account.

After resetting the password via the received link, you‚Äôll be able to log in using the original email. That‚Äôs a zero-click account takeover through the email‚Äôs local part and it‚Äôs just as impactful.

üí° 2FA Bypass Tip: If site uses 2Fa and application mishandles email normalization (like treating gm√°il.com as gmail.com), an attacker can register as victim@gm√°il.com, set up 2FA and then use their own 2FA code to log into victim@gmail.com.

Ifyou don‚Äôt have Burp Suite Pro, you can use the Interactsh client instead ‚Äî it works just as well and is much easier to use.


üèÜ Subscriber Success: Bounty Earned!
After I dropped my Punycode ATO video, one of my subscribers found the same bug on a live target same day and landed $2.422 bounty and others subscriber are still in triage phase.


Mitigation: How Developers Can Prevent This
Enforce strict email validation
Only allow ASCII characters in email input fields (e.g., using regex or input sanitization libraries).
Normalize email addresses consistently
Convert Unicode to ASCII (e.g., using IDN.toASCII() or equivalent) and apply consistent normalization across all flows.
Block IDN and Punycode domains if not required
Reject emails containing Punycode-prefixed domains (like xn ‚Äî example) unless your app supports international domains.
Apply consistent logic in signup, login, and reset flows
Make sure email validation and comparison use the same logic everywhere to avoid mismatches or bypasses.

If you want to dive deeper into how this vulnerability works under the hood including backend behavior and normalization details. I highly recommend checking out the in-depth article by the Voorivex team. They‚Äôve done an excellent job breaking down the full technical flow.
